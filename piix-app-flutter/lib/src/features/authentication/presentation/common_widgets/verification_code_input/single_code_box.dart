///The use of the [invisibleChar] is because OS such as [Android] or [iOS]

///that the focus goes to the previous one when pressing backspace "key" on an
///empty [TextFormField]. By adding an [invisibleChar] instead of clearing
///the value when the backspace "key" is pressed it will instead be replaced
///with the [invisibleChar] and then detect if the delta comes from
///[invisibleChar] to empty which creates the same effect as pressing the
///backspace "key" since the user since will only see a blank field.
///
///For the [invisibleChar] to work a [TextEditingController] is used
///to initialize the value to [invisibleChar] and to listen to any changes
